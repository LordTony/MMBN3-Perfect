# MMBN3-Perfect

A Rom Hack for Mega Man Battle Network 3 - Blue that aims to add everything from the white version of the game and remove some smaller frustrations with the game.



## Desired Features

- Add Mistman into the game somehow
  
  - This has already been done with a hex editor over a year ago, but it wasn't done to my level of satisfaction.
  
  - Perhaps all we really need is the Mistman Beta battle to grind chips on, but part of me also feels like being able to choose between Mistman and Bowlman as you are going through the story of the game is also a good add. Not 100% conviced, though.

- Add White version chip rewards into the standard battle reward pool
  
  - Some of the codes are exclusive to one version or the other. Need to look up what those difference are.

- Add White version chips to the chip vendors
  
  - One in the hospital (If I remember correctly)
  
  - One in the postgame area
  
  - Everyone who sells something should be looked at for version differences

- Cut content? Should I put the punk man chips into the game? Not sure what that would mangle. Not sure if we even want that.

- Special codes that don't appear in the game, add them into the possible fortune cookie notes
  
  - Everyone online says "you need to watch the anime" or "you get that info from the manga", but I spend hours searching through anime and manga for those codes and didn't find jack, and I think those people are just parroting what they've been told or read somewhere. Everyone who got the Muramasa chip cheated by looking it up online, and that is a failing of the game. The game should be 100% self contained. Everything obtainable in the game should tell you how to obtain it in game.

- Equipping and unequipping the press chip and that chip that lets you light stuff on fire is just annoying and tedious. Should just check for if that chip is owned or not. Perhaps even just check if the story progression is far enough along rather than checking if those chips are equipped. Would like to not even show them in the list of equippable chips.

- Add in all Giga chips from white. (In locations that are appropriate)
  
  - Need to also add in the chip art and make them show up in the menus

- The trade only or link battle Giga chips, maybe just make them something really expensive for sale in the post game from the chip seller or the undernet bugfrag vendor

- Change out the title screen? Maybe pay someone on fiver for the pixel art.

- Add in the white version exclusive styles is it "ground style"? I forgot, look that up.

- Might be impossible at my current skill level, but I would love to have some kind of system where you can switch freely between styles you've unlocked already.
  
  - Maybe Equippable "style override" chips?
  
  - Ideal solution would just be an extra menu on the start/status screen that adds in the elements and forms (electric team, etc...)
  
  - Maybe just cut the number of battles needed for a style change in half?
    
    - Don't really like this idea even though it's baby easy to implement.

- The code to get the 5th star and unlock the giga chip navis isn't hinted at anywhere in the game. I either need to add that into a fortune cookie or just remove the need  for that code altogether. What were they thinking with this? The only way to get those Giga chips was to look them up online? People playing the game legit in the schoolyards were probably getting curb-stomped by normies because all the good stuff was impossible to get without cheating.

- More...? Who knows? I will probably find more stuff
