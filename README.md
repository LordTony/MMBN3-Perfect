# MMBN3-Perfect

A Rom Hack for Mega Man Battle Network 3 - Blue that aims to add everything from the white version of the game and remove some smaller frustrations with the game.

  - NavRcycl ✅
  - AlphArmΣ ❌
  - Bass ❌
  - Serenade ❌
  - Balance ❌

- No longer need to equip (2/2)
  - Press ✅
  - EngyChng ✅

## Current Research Goal

- Find out how to make the giga chip reward use the normal checkboard swipe effect

## How to build / use / install

- Will worry about this part once I have a bit more progress

## Desired Features (Not Yet Complete / Notes)

- Add Mistman into the game somehow  
  - This has already been done with a hex editor over a year ago, but it wasn't done to my level of satisfaction.
  - Perhaps all we really need is the Mistman Beta battle to grind chips on, but part of me also feels like being able to choose between Mistman and Bowlman as you are going through the story of the game is also a good add. Not 100% conviced, though.

- Add White version chip rewards into the standard battle reward pool
  - Some of the codes are exclusive to one version or the other. Need to look up what those difference are.

- Add White version chips to the chip vendors
  - Hospital
  - TV Studio
  - Postgame area
  - Everyone who sells something should be looked at for version differences

- Cut content? I think I'll put the Punk Man Chips into the game. I think there is only 1 of them anyway.

- Special codes that don't appear in the game, add them into the possible fortune cookie notes
  - Everyone online says "you need to watch the anime" or "you get that info from the manga", but I spend hours searching through anime and manga for those codes and didn't find jack, and I think those people are just parroting what they've been told or read somewhere. Everyone who got the Muramasa chip cheated by looking it up online, and that is a failing of the game. The game should be 100% self contained. Everything obtainable in the game should tell you how to obtain it in game.

- Add in all Giga chips from white. (In locations that are appropriate)
  - Need to also add in the chip art and make them show up in the menus

- The trade only or link battle Giga chips, maybe just make them something really expensive for sale in the post game from the chip seller or the undernet bugfrag vendor

- Change out the title screen? Maybe pay someone on fiver for the pixel art.

- "Ground Style" 
  - On top of just adding it, I will need to figure out what the algorithm for choosing ground style is. Hopefully it's still in the game and just rerolls whenever ground style shows up.

- Might be impossible at my current skill level, but I would love to have some kind of system where you can switch freely between styles you've unlocked already.
  - Ideal solution would just be an extra menu on the start/status screen that adds in the elements and forms (electric team, etc...)

- The code to get the 5th star and unlock the giga chip navis isn't hinted at anywhere in the game. I either need to add that into a fortune cookie or just remove the need  for that code altogether. What were they thinking with this? The only way to get those Giga chips was to look them up online? People playing the game legit in the schoolyards were probably getting curb-stomped by normies because all the good stuff was impossible to get without cheating.

- Mr. Famous' apprentice

- Re-battle the Omega Navis
  - I think I might just be able to steal a mod that does this already and reverse engineer that one.

## Things that won't be changed, but is still tempting

- Black Mind and Humor will still need to be equipped.
  - They are only used in a few quests here and there, are don't get in the way nearly as much as EngyChng and Press

- 100 Battles per style change is staying
  - I don't want this to be a balance mod or an easy mod. Even though it's hella tedious, I want to keep the game feeling the same way. That said, I am still so tempted to cut it in half. If this mod takes off and people want this, I'll add it in. I just feel like it takes a way from the spirit of the game a little bit.
